# micro-meteorological-station
##INTRO
Micro meteorological station(mms) is a device bases on Raspberry Pi to detect environment including temperature, humidity, luminance, pressure,  geographical coordinate, air quality, and rainfall. It is a part of my personal project smart detection solution.

###Extend
Obviously, it is still a rudiment so that can not be competent for many kinds of engineering work, but it can be powerful and extended to other applications through some improvement, such as:

+ Smart Home
+ Outdoor Meteorological Station
+ Intelligent Agriculture
+ ...
